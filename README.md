## Contributors

Mullet Stack was created on a Thursday night by [Linda Nichols](http://www.github.com/lynnaloo). Name inspiration by [Ryan Brunsvold](http://www.github.com/brunsvold) who probably wishes to not be credited on something called "The Mullet Stack."

Mullet Cat Logo design by [Lookmai Rattana](http://www.github.com/cosmicmeow).

[Weyland](http://www.github.com/weyj4) moved us on up from Gulp/Browserify to Webpack.

Special thanks to all of the people that have taken their time to submit [pull requests](https://github.com/lynnaloo/mullet/graphs/contributors) to make Mullet better!
